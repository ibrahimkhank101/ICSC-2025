## ðŸŽ¯ The Problems

The qualification round was designed to test a broad set of skills, from theoretical knowledge to practical implementation:

-   **Problem A: Neural Network Components `[Conceptual]`**
    -   Task: Identify and label the core components of a Multi-layer Perceptron diagram, demonstrating foundational knowledge of neural network architecture.

-   **Problem B: Cake Calculator `[Programming]`**
    -   Task: Write a function to calculate the maximum number of cakes that could be baked given a finite inventory of flour and sugar, testing algorithmic thinking and resource management.

-   **Problem C: The School Messaging App `[Conceptual]`**
    -   Task: Analyze character frequencies and calculate information entropy and average code length for a Fano code, showing an understanding of information theory.

-   **Problem D: Word Search Puzzle `[Programming]`**
    -   Task: Implement a function to generate a 10x10 word search puzzle from a given list of words, requiring skills in 2D arrays, string manipulation, and creative placement logic.

-   **Problem E: Functional Completeness of NAND `[Conceptual]`**
    -   Task: Prove that the NAND gate is functionally complete by expressing AND, OR, and NOT operations using only NAND, a fundamental concept in digital logic.

## ðŸ’¡ My Solutions & Implementations

I submitted code for the two programming problems and detailed written solutions for the three conceptual problems.

### Programming Solutions
-   **`cake_calculator.py`:** A straightforward and efficient iterative solution that calculates the number of cakes possible based on the most constrained ingredient, ensuring optimal resource use.
-   **`word_search_generator.py`:** A creative implementation that uses a randomized placement algorithm to position words horizontally, vertically, and diagonally within a 10x10 grid, then fills the remaining spaces with random letters.

### Conceptual Solutions
-   The detailed written solutions and mathematical proofs for problems A, C, and E can be found in the following document:
