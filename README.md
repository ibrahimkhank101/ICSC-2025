This repository contains my successful submission for the Qualification Round of the ICSC 2025, an international extracurricular science competition for high school and university students.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Challenge: [Name of the Problem, e.g., "Logistics Optimization"]

The task was to develop a program that could solve [**briefly and clearly describe the problem you were given.** For example: "...an optimization problem where the goal was to find the most efficient route for a delivery drone through a grid of city blocks, avoiding obstacles and minimizing fuel consumption."]

The solution had to be not only logically correct but also highly efficient to pass a series of hidden test cases, including edge cases and large-scale performance tests.

## ðŸ’¡ My Solution

I approached this challenge by implementing [**describe your core algorithm or method.** For example: "...a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore possible routes." or "...a dynamic programming approach to cache sub-problem solutions and reduce redundant calculations."]

The key aspects of my implementation were:
- **Data Structures:** [e.g., I used a queue for the BFS traversal and a 2D array to represent the city grid.]
- **Efficiency:** [e.g., I focused on minimizing the time complexity by ensuring no node was visited more than once, which was crucial for passing the larger test cases.]
- **Correctness:** [e.g., My code correctly handled all specified edge cases, such as grids with no valid path or multiple equally optimal paths.]

## âœ… Result: Qualified with Special Honour

My submission **successfully passed all test cases** provided by the evaluators.

As a result, I received a **special honour** from the competition coordinators and have **qualified for the Pre-Final round**.
